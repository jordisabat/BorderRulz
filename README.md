# Flutter #HACK20 - BorderRulz

## Description

Know the rules and restrictions of travelling during the virus pandemic? Select your destination and we help you find the way.

## Additional Information

We are a group of 3 people (2 developers, 1 designer) with different nationalities, currently living in Portugal and trying to figure out how we can visit to our families or return to work during this pandemic. We want to share the latest information of the restrictions of each country worldwide to be best prepared for travelling and challenges along the way. The community can give their input, so we'll know with more certainty what is the real situation in every place/ border / country.
